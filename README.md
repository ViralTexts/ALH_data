# ALH_data
This is where additional data about the Viral Texts project lives.

The .csv file here is the top 50,000 lines of the dataset from 1836 to 1861. For more detailed exploration,
or for the larger 19th-century dataset, see viraltexts.northeastern.edu. Also note that the .csv is actually tab-delimited.

The .gephi file contains network visualizations of the pre-1861 dataset.
